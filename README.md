code refactoring



Thoughts about the code::

It's booking related thing, which includes user jobs based on their roles, store and update user jobs related to booking,
sending emails, history of user jobs, accept/ cancelled jobs and resend notification etc.

The bad thing about the code is too lengthy functions quite confusing, repetitive code,
No macros for responses, use less checks, no proper naming variables, 
no exceptions etc.


My Input or Considerations:

1: Optimize functions and make them short to easily understandable
2: Remove duplicate code or useless checks
3: Apply SOLID principles
4: Add authorization logic security
5: Add DB Transactions
